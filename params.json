You can either:\r\n\r\n Get the source code directly by downloading the .zip or .tar.gz file to your local PC.\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n Install git and clone the entire repo to your local disk:\r\n\r\n    mkdir /home/jahufar/jkcs-training\r\n    git clone git@github.com:jahufar/jkcs-training.git .\r\n\r\nIf you're using Windows, please download and install [msysGit] (http://msysgit.github.com/).\r\n\r\n### Projects and Source Code\r\n\r\n1. **HelloWorldPoject:** The project that introduced the basic concepts: getting ADT going with Eclipse, setting up a project, creating and AVD and starting the emulator, intro to the Manifest.xml creating your first activity, starting a new activity at runtime via intents and passing parameter between activities.\r\n\r\n1. **BarCodeExample:** An example of how to use StartActivityForResult() to call an external application (ZXING) via a Intent to allow the user to scan and return back bar-code data.\r\n\r\n1. **ContactPickerProject:** Demonstrates how to use a targeted intent to launch and allow the user to pick a contact from the address book\r\n\r\n1. **AllAboutListsProject:** Code that demonstrates a plain-old listview, a listview that uses ListActivity and a custom Listview with performance optimizations.\r\n\r\n1. **ServicesProject:** A very simple project that demonstrates the concepts behind Android services. Please refer to the OpenExchangeProject for more advanced service example.\r\n\r\n1. **AllAboutThreadsProject:** Demonstrates the 2 supported threading mechanisms: Handlers and AsyncTask. Also demonstrates how to avoid activity leaks during when device configuration changes occur.\r\n\r\n1. **BatteryBroadcastReciever:** Example on how to use a BroadcastReceiver to listen for system events - this example demonstrates to monitor battery life in real time.\r\n\r\n1. **LocationProject:**\tDemonstrates how to work with location providers such as GPS and cell towers and get notified when the phone moves or when a user enters a proximity region you previously set.\r\n\r\n1. **InternalContentProvidersProject**: Demonstrates how to query the content providers exposed by Android. Examples includes querying the: phone call log, browser history and bookmarks, address book and phone settings.\r\n\r\n1. **SensorTestProject:** A test harness type application that would query your device for list of supported sensors and start reading data for each of them, dumping the raw output to screen.\r\n \r\n1. **ShakeitBabyProject:** Not written in class. Demonstrates the use of the accelerometer sensor to detect when the user shakes the device. Will come in handy if you want to build in a \"Shake-to-Refresh\" feature on your app.\r\n\r\n1. **OpenExchangeProject:** A (mostly) complete and (semi) useful app that was developed in stages. Uses almost all of the concepts learnt previously (Services, Alarms, WakeLocks, Network Access, Threading/ASyncTask, JSON parsing, Sqlite DB, BroadcastRecievers, SharedPreferences) plus a couple of extras (AutoComplete textfields and context menus). There will be a couple of more updates to this project over this weekend - will be adding a content provider to expose the data to other processes. \r\n\r\n### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1.

[Fake GPS] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en): Allows you to fake your location in real time. Useful debugging tool when you are writing location based apps.\r\n\r\n1. [RoboGuice] (http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/): A useful Dependency Injection helper library for Android.\r\n\r\n1. [Application Crash Report for Android (ACRA)] (http://code.google.com/p/acra/): Crash reporting made easy. Useful for QA and beta testing your app in the real world.\r\n\r\n1. [Urban Airship] (http://urbanairship.com/): A cross-platform push notification server solution.\r\n\r\n1. [Flurry] (http://www.flurry.com/): The best mobile cross platform analytics service out there (better than [Google Analytics for Android] (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/resources), IMHO) \r\n \r\n1. [SQLite Browser] (http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/): A free tool to work with SQLite DBs (also see: [SQLite Manager (Firefox extension)] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/)\r\n\r\n1. [android-maven-plugin] (code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/): An Android plugin for Maven build utility.\r\n\r\n1. [Jackson JSON] (http://jackson.codehaus.org/): The native JSON package shipped with Android is not very efficient when you need to parse complexly formatted or large chunks of JSON markup (uses CPU/battery and causes a lot of GC). For relatively simple markup such as the currency REST service we worked with, native JSON parser worked fine but if you want high performance, then Jackson is the JSON processor you should check out.\r\n \r\n1. [Proguard] (http://proguard.sourceforge.net/): Is a tool that shrinks, optimizes and obfuscates your code by removing unused code and renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure names. The result is a smaller sized .apk file that is more difficult to reverse engineer.\r\n\r\n### Getting in Touch\r\n\r\nI can be reached via the following ways, if needed:\r\n\r\n* Phone: 0718 50 52 53\r\n* E-mail/Gtalk: jahufar@gmail.com\r\n* Skype: jahufar\r\n* Twitter DM: @jahufar\r\n\r\nThank you and I wish you the best on your Android journey.\r\n\r\n-j","tagline":"The JKCS Android training sessions: Notes & Code ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
